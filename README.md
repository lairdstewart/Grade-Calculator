# Grade-Calculator
First Java GUI with Swing to calculate a weighted grade for a class. 

First column takes a double for the weight of that assignment between 0 and 1. 

Second column takes the grade for that assignment. If the assignment was out of 100, this can simply be the double of the grade out of 100 (ex. 88.8). Or if the assignment is not out of 100, it can be written as a fraction (ex. 15/20).
